%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

To update groups based on %WIKITOOLNAME% content, the plugin jumps in after
each topic save, processes its group update rules, and updates groups
according to it.

As an administrator, you can define rules by creating a topic with special
contents, and pointing to it in the %WIKITOOLNAME% configuration (via
=/bin/configure= or in the =lib/LocalSite.cfg= file). Here's an example of
what the topic should contain:

<verbatim>
| *Group* | *Condition* | *Members* |
| MyFancyAllUsersGroup | | %SOLRSEARCH{web="%USERSWEB%" "form:*UserForm" format="$topic" separator="," rows="12345"}% |
| DocumentResponsibleGroup | | %SOLRSEARCH{web="Documents" "type:topic" facets="field_Responsible_s" separator_field_Responsible_s=", " format_field_Responsible_s="$key"}% |
</verbatim>

In this example, assuming !SolrPlugin is available, !MyFancyAllUsersGroup will
contain all users known to %WIKITOOLNAME, and !DocumentResponsibleGroup will
contain all values given in the "Responsible" form field in any topic in the
Documents web.

A cell in the =Condition= column, if empty, has no effect. Otherwise, macros
in it are expanded and if the result is a true value (e.g. =yes=, =on=,
=true=), the rule will be applied; otherwise it will be ignored.
